I draw movie , curious see adapt Hubert Shelby 's brutal novel . I think literary piece depth , rich tapestry character , horrid situation , social critique could translate bad movie .

Frank Capra 's creativity must spend time make film . while charming moment , many wonderful performer , Capra 's outright recycling script considerable footage first version story , Broadway Bill , downright shoddy . it understandable would reuse footage climactic horse race , thrill . but use entire dialogue scene minor actor , bring back actor apparently expect us notice , example , Ward bond year old unless want see one last appearance Oliver Hardy , skip one watch Broadway Bill instead .

Korolev designer prison design bureau bury dead prisoner . but movie Korolev work grave digger jailer shoulder strap uniform . IMHO , author movie profound knowledge part history ca n't make interesting movie .
I familiar fantastic book ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' absolutely age recently I get chance watch adaption . I hear lot positive remark , I high hope . once film finish , I replaced-dns film good film .

easily bad movie I ever see life . direction none . story pathetic . screenplay good idea . there lot gratuitous graphics , pathetic quality . preserve sanity , dont ever see movie
I would give one instead two , I suppose COULD bad . I guess acting n't bad , plot lack anything even remotely close interesting . it terrible movie TERRIBLE complete waste time I strongly suggest watch movie .
I usually comment movie I like , figure " everyone hisher taste , " I want make exception . the premise movie , somehow seem get lose shuffle , two selfcentered adult perfect right go Las Vegas , get drunk , get marry , inflict incalculable suffering upon respective brood child . even allow culturally sanction inebriation , neither courage sense responsibility wake next morning undo set motion . after , " love " be important , n't to hell everybody else . whether thing " work end " really point ; fact be quite irrelevant . the point disrespect other , especially young person , especially position dependency , make light thereby reinforce movie . there far innocuous behavior " parent " could perform would bring army social worker head heartbeat .
give money back give life back give bit credit . this movie vomit worthy . useless time consuming . what waste energy totally pointless . okay I understand premise idea sound , give us break next time give money let spend . lose child , mother remorse , blame husband Clich yes get life sorry movie total waste time , money .

even could get past idea boring character personally witness every significant Moment ok , Katie n't join Manson Family , nobody die Altamont , movie still unbelievably awful .

spoiler AHEADThis one bad movie ever make be simple . there one redeeming quality movie . the first minute quite tricky actually lead believe film shocking edge seat . instead , spend minute punch watch stolen poorly make scene run without organization . the lake ridiculous , look like aquarium , plant different part lake bed . character show advanced teleportation power , example Alex Thomas fall lake drunk , end boat impossible position . Angie Harmon put pitiful performance Kate , make bad spacetime continuum rupture dialog appear write last minute fifth grader . an example would say , " Flashlight " stupid manner show threshold much human body cringe snap half . finally , edit movie far bizarre horrific I ever see . it like cameraman bunch chimp give camcorder scientist . an example would suddenly get closeup headlight Alex 's car . I would bet little time spend edit movie . the end absolutely pathetic . the writer obviously try create sort mysterious plot line make viewer say , " oh yeah " instead , be leave view dumb painting spider somehow fit story line . unfortunately , one perspective million could save movie fester piece crap.I. give . , . fact movie record film instead become picture book .

I suspect movie , anything , attempt Bette Davis help husband 's Gary Merrill career . to avail however I see oak tree display genuine emotion replaced-dns ' play happy cripple i.e. , nonglamorous role probably look edgy bold career move . it n't . it boring . she kind Tiny Tim film , make Trask Merrill 's character see truth love forgiveness although less winsome Tiny Tim , calmly dispense wisdom life relationship without hint beloved husband replaced-dns final scene , Trask call wife back Iowa reconcile , affect overact end phone line , I almost cringe . I remind people actually get pay film.I. notice lot people seem enjoy movie . if find uplift , be great . but frankly , I find bad . there plenty old movie Golden Age Hollywood far well write act .

SNL pretty funny people say like watch short skit SNL little dumb mind . it be NOTHING like SNL , be stupid piece replaced-dns Samberg try act like Jon Heder fail . although Jon Heder funny Napoleon Dynamite Andy try hard people think be replaced-dns funny people movie Danny McBride Bill Hader . the part decently funny Andy pool replaced-dns could make " Quiet place " lot well n't make fall scene freak replaced-dns part be pronounce H 's retarded . they try go long half time look like Andy laugh act ... be horrible actor n't deserve replaced-dns movie joke simple minded people brain year old level comedy . which half United States .
I look forward see movie read positive review New York Times . in addition , I be also Shanghainese pass interest subject matter . however , watch , I extremely replaced-dns movie 's pace excruciatingly slow monotonous . the director linger certain scene much long . there passion chemistry lover . there barely dialogue . dialogue sorely need compensate lack act . at end movie , n't feel compassion character . this movie lack everything . the script weak , act poor , edit nonexistent . the director try emulate certain noir film style fail miserably . a good movie one capture attention , maintain successful conclude without feel time pass . this movie feel though would never end . do n't waste money movie .
I feel like I have , con , n't fall . after read glowing review director film reviewer sky year must lot mate press ready favour write favorable review I expect solid acting , atmosphere , suspense , strong characterization , intriguing plot development poetic moment . sadly , ' Sixteen year Alcohol ' , n't deliver critic promise , part , sacrifice quality lieu cheesy low budget special effect clichd cobweb scene , unrealistic fight choreography mindless mind numb narration , clich edit camera angles.'Sixteen year Alcohol ' start interestingly beautiful location shot Scotland , be straight downhill . unfortunately , instead spend time building atmosphere , create character might care , build suspense director opt begin drive crazy self indulgent heavy hand twaddle voiceover 's . the lead character unsympathetic badly act audience n't care happen , desperate actor desperate thing ... like movie . to make matter worse , ' homage be ' typical director try pay due past master either utterly clich unconvincing . the soundtrack thing lift keep cinema even fail support dramatic narrative connect period time replaced-dns reason movie get increasingly flawed quite honest annoy . I still watch whole damn thingI guess I like attempt gritty realism film even destroy often intercut weird abstract , sometimes pointless scene . you n't need huge budget make truly move film , much say little money make film , half million little bit money ... So No excuse sometimes I wonder actor ... or agent thinkingPass turkey unless be masochistic mindless anyway ... .NOT My Thing .
another bad low go one . otherwise would get easy zero . truly one bad film I ever see . in fact Peckenpah 's name thing I would never guess . actually one people San Francisco I know set lot nearly sunup say Sam plain snockered . it show spade . the laughing bit early part film only thing entire mess worth second look . not even Gig Young watchable . this true test masochism . have I force confine theatre see I would jump scream . and I truly feel guilty watch confine comfortable couch nice leave . what mess , seem less write make go along . it be bomb bmob spell backwards . yike
irritate , illogical flow event . pretty much every joke simple hardly regard one . wonder cinema empty people actually walk away , yes away . I stay , since I enjoy wonderful icecream nut whole movie .
with exception Family , new season bad Season one . I ca n't imagine think . as fan horror , tolerate lot gore mindless mayhem , series get bad outing . I ca n't imagine dishearten must actor crew go work day , toil churn crap . story be much ask CHARACTER how give damn fate ANYONE story if engage , care get carve whatever almost every episode end mindless blood let , go gross shock without sense revelation conclusion Reason subject hour bloodletting . even Dante 's effort season disturbing sexist violence wander pointless conclusion . ironically , production value performance tend speed , content utter crap . I great hope Exec Producer 's Garris 's Valarie UNDER THE Stairs , shall see .
once , movie sweep along stun , draw , awe , , end , leave renewed belief human race artistry form . this . this action movie lack convincing action . it stink . rent something else .
the first half OK , last half really , really disappoint . it be funny producer even admit n't clue ending , really show . Whats really sad write ten line comment minimum able post . I really n't want include spoiler qualify remark since show n't really worth effort . when Battlestar galatica first come I really excite prospect good remake , n't happen first season border space porn . they eventually clean bit actually pretty fair drama , I start watch . but end series kara cyclon god angel , baltar six pretty dumb .
I really horrify eerie movie . what unusual dark atmosphere . and creepy musical score . really promise indeed , ten minute really start sweat , feel uncomfortable , start fear bad . this movie atmosphere true nightmare , be worseit come . for one hour half I try fight complete boredom fall asleep , monstrous soundtrack keep awake . Nuit noire truly horrify picture eye , ear , intelligence , wallet , since thought spend precious money movie ticket cheap amateuristic homevideo big horror .
before I begin , I want briefly say movie well make well act involve , include Whittaker , indeed deserve nomination . it highly entertaining , . . . take right context work FICTION , good movie . for , I give two replaced-dns , rather waste time read hundred time elsewhere , I want instead point absolute fictional nature film dangerous sell people work fiction truth . I stress film nowhere credit let us know main character , Dr. Nicholas Garrigan , complete invention fiction . rather , present character real historical setting , allow uninformed viewer assume fact real , see truth . I problem blending fact fiction dishonest matter , word , replaced-dns doubt Africa , along Third World Countries rife human misery suffering . Hollywood long attempt capture suffering people country film . but Hollywood also eye toward make money . the true way capture suffering seem happen everywhere West either experience , least capture honest replaced-dns depiction fictional character real historical setting much . at end day , become less present fact viewer decide , lead image image hit head scream , " See , WE tell you it WAS Bad " the seminal example find anyone willing watch documentary DVD sit movie . arguably shocking image film viewing body Kay Amin , Idi 's second wife , kill discover infidelity . in film , see limb sever reattach reverse arm leg viceversa . this director make sure understand Amin , Gungans say , Bombad but watch documentary , learn fact nothing myth , sit Minister Health time tell us replaced-dns . . . . . . MAKE up thing why because Hollywood low opinion intelligence , be they n't trust us come right conclusion . look , murder dismember enough us conclude Amin likable guy portray medium n't need Texas chainsaw MASSACRE inspire imagery reinforce and tip iceberg . what also explain casual viewer lead character Garrigan fictional . there young Scottish doctor take Amin 's wing . as , Garrigan clearly present sake help us dumb westerner understand African world . the producer seem thing wo n't interested film Africa unless white face . ironically , even titular character portray American black actor the problem movie long expose Amin regime , instead exploitative thriller white Westerner come Africa wrong reason , make several horrible mistake , " redeem " , even cost three innocent life . honestly , I say nearly reprehensible suggest real tragic death Mrs. Amin result tryst fictional Scottish doctor almost seem become morbid joke sake entertainment I really wish Hollywood would stop jerk us around money . I first realize propensity woefully manipulative a beautiful mind , Ron Howard Akiva Goldsman 's sugarysweet adaptation life John Nash , delete dark side man present tortured hero America ca n't get enough . the sad truth Hollywood sell us fake year , viewer , predictably understandably lazy uncare investigate , buy fake portrait hook , line , replaced-dns , I be certainly suggest Amin turn villain n't . my point , truth shocking enough convince us brutality man , must Hollywood go fictional length why must Hollywood continue insult us hold hand film why trust us think can put honest portrayal screen let audience decide I urge continue watch Hollywood 's purportedly " true " movie favor ALWAYS investigate , Never assume screen even close truth

if I create movie thermometer , movie would absolute zero . out ten star , I would rate followsPlot zero star Video quality zero star sound Quality zero star act zero starsIt though high school student get together one afternoon camera , make plot shoot movie . it lack artistic value I will rather watch kid walk around high school watch replaced-dns , something say abysymal depth . the " shootout " staircase one trainwreck funny scene ever . first , combatant simply wave plastic gun , jerk arm back forth simulate recoil . the pair actually " duck " 's nonexistent bullet . no squib , spark , blank , wave spraypainted squirtguns around . if want see two grown man play " actor " , give spin someday ... clean fridge , comb carpet , polish doorknob , rake gravel , straighten book shelf , etc.
I sit glue screen , rivet , yawn , yet keep attentive eye .

I can believe woodenly write direct piece cliche film get make . there four good look shot director think switch still photography be . a strong cast utterly waste , scene repeatedly end least interesting moment script say nothing new . please spare movie .
the cast OK . the script awkward time , take figure point movie . I find look forward dish . the Shehan bit cheesy statement war . I guess suppose notice ... . its house , nothing kill forty five minute . the shower part ... huh what literally , I client , " Ok use shower . " Yawn . the angle try way hard . there set wood , suddenly go cause see right , next deep animal die . in end horrendous movie boring proportion .
I , also endure hundred child 's movie past , consider one bad I ever see .

there reason take documentary serious four reason the people make documentary include director producer Serbs Serbian origin , therefore criterion neutrality fail . for instance , mention Diaspora Croat call " Ustase " play huge part fall Yugoslavia , n't mention equal Serbian organization well Cetniks for n't familiar Balkan WW history the Serbian call " Cetniks " portray documentary kind help British paratroops war . well , be half truth . they also fascist Monarch group collaborate Germans , switch side Hitler start lose war . it be also ironic n't mention Cetnik leader Mihajlovic documentary , man responsible kill thousand people burn hundred village Bosnia Croatia . but mention certain Ante Pavelic ... hm ...

the premise Circle Two intriguing one . a forbidden love sixty year old painter Ashleigh Richard Burton fifteen year old girl Sarah Norton Tatum O'Neill ; question whether relationship acceptable given society 's standard . the problem Circle Two , however , fail live promise . Director Jules Dassin Hedley put thought screenplay . when I watch film , I expect learn something new love sexuality . instead , I get boring dialogue , pointless lecture art , outing Sarah seem fun away Ashleigh , closing scene artificial emotional impact lose . this script make good actor look bad . so one imagine film 's problem compound even largely amateurish cast Jules Dassin assemble . Tatum O'Neill element .

" the silver lining one day intelligent film elder painter teenage girl fall love may one day make . if film ever appear , surely spark controversy , debate question many year come .

everyone else comment negatively film do excellent analysis film bloody awful . I n't go comment , film bug much , writerdirector particular . so I must toss hat join naysayers.I. see original " Wicker Man " really love cornucopia music , sensuality , paganism modern world , clash theological belief . this say , I part crowd think remake great movie n't do . for example , I like original ' " invasion Body Snatchers " , equally enjoy remake . both film stand . another example " the thing " . the original , campy look compare today 's standard , lot proud remake Kurt Russell time favorite horror movie . so small minority people like " the Wicker Man " remake accuse dissing piece crap be replaced-dns film solidify Neil LaBute 's sexism misogynistic tendency . it also make wonder executive , want make serious thriller , would green light product antifemale . there many scene Cage hit woman be frustrate thwart investigation missing girl . would react like island case suspect n't forthcoming the original create society man woman equal participant Goddess base religion . the threat main character come everyone , male female . there sexual replaced-dns metaphor bee , drone etc bit heavy hand convenient " the drone must die " , especially Cage 's character bee allergy . I keep wonder man island n't fight back use mere physicality stop woman treat like grunt . these woman special supernatural power , half seem pregnant , half old fat , rest girl thin blonde waif , man really want escape could man hate woman . physically dominate . there n't seem gun weapon beyond cut tool hold unhappy . but content drone , make unable speak they could use threat Cage defend community . they drone Neil LaBute seem believe society run woman would leave man castrate . that movie make already . " the Stepford Wives " anyone classic symptom man afraid may happen woman get sht together truly equal replaced-dns problem manhating female society make uninteresting movie viewing create unintentional humor Cage start knock woman . I belief LaBute have leave society egalitarian one , keep sexuality uninhibited lasciviousness , push button discomfort regard child island . no one like pedophiles child sexually exploit . so would cop react see lewd act perform adult child around there would logical mental leap child abuse , thus , urgency create save missing child get help child . LaBute say create fianc daughter story thread give Cage 's character incentive search . I n't think need . any child abuse make adult react save . the irony course would child Cage " save " ultimately bring replaced-dns dialogue contrived campy . the whole third act hilarious . the audience I see guffaw later boo end . I think movie start wrong letter arrive write fancy handwriting flashback cut show wounded Cage . we n't need . just show arrive island investigation missing child . most us America see " Law Order " cop procedural . we come movie Cage 's partner solve replaced-dns much potential ... waste . Neil LaBute , stick talk head picture people enjoy male angstridden play flick sort . stay company man . leave thriller people understand thriller . here jar honey . I will watch .

I like movie , movie like summary . the Biggest Sack Crap ever . in beginning , Chris Rock play aspiring comedian get stage fright Comedy Building call Apollo . on way home gig , ride bike see woman like hit Truck . a little later , choose body old , white , selfish millionaire . then , dress like music group Outkast try replay scene original come Jockey . second , go back Apollo , try comedian try previous body start dissing white population try black . do get drift this movie awful try hard like original process come look like sack crap . just take advice , n't even watch movie .
SPOILERSI watch half movie I n't like replaced-dns reason Boring . barely anything happen , woman sit around discuss terrible life hope , smoke weed , read magazine , care sick friend , cut occasional dead body . BORINGSecond reason there many thing leave unexplained . many scene dedicate zombie hunter kidnap random man , restrain chair interrogate . who man how know anything illegal activity concern diseased flesh eater why kill one let another one goAlso dude first I think also flesh eat disease put fist wall superhuman strength suggest be quite originally thoughtnever explain how frustrate thatConclusion I find woman annoy , story uninteresting , duologue tedious , action nonexistent . also cover art mislead since make believe movie go cool clearly n't . I rent movie base review make people website , although I respect fact people might enjoy flick , I make sure I read two review deep movie avoid rent another movie I regret see .
oh . how make movie beauty , terribly bad . I mean , even Uwe Boll n't make crap like . there even hint decent story , multilayer character , attraction . it be random sequence pointless chatter join together make ' movie ' .

when I first see glimpse movie , I quickly notice actress play role Lucille Ball . Rachel York 's portrayal Lucy absolutely awful . Lucille Ball astound comedian incredible talent . to think legend like Lucille Ball portray way movie horrendous .

" Exorcism " unoriginal , be also insufferably boring film here Naschy director Juan Bosch open opportunity make religiously them exploitation flick full shock gore , yet result tame overall bloodless drama will nearly put sleep the last twenty minute contain atmospheric moment , albeit stupid , be quite lot stylishly film female nudity sleaze . the absolute lack budget real excuse since Paul Naschy already prove enough imagination make shortage money . this awful film , end story . other European " the Excorcist " ripoff " the Antichrist " " beyond Door " suck well

this movie simply far long , far repetitive , male nudity sexuality say gay collection adult title far gratuitous unnecessary . much first third movie could cut ten minute equally effective without try patience stamina audience.I. see movie early Saturday afternoon , film festival audience ; type crowd tend adventuresome , interested experimental atypical film , one without much dialog , short , foreign film . the near sell crowd approximate seat theater start dribble within first half movie great majority stay " pay " never actually arrive , I never , year attend number film festival , experimental , gay otherwise , see large number people walk away replaced-dns movie could easily cut half effective . it also could go different direction , still short running time , far replaced-dns currently exist , something one readily recommend one I would desire watch .

a seemingly endless movie really deserve zero rating . the premise seem simple enough Yentl , girl interested study Talmud , want go school . but boy allow study , father 's death decide disguise boy get . she become close friend Avigdor , marry beautiful woman name Hadass . Hadass ' family learn Avigdor 's brother committed suicide , wedding call . Yentl , call Anschel , select marry Hadass . she never consummate . YentlAnschel Avigdor go away day , YentlAnschel reveal secret . the movie end Avigdor return marry Hadass , Yentl go America continue study although continue replaced-dns plot seem interesting first movie hour long , several thing ruin . for starter , constant singing . I already hear critic shouting . yes , I know musical suppose lot song dance number . but movie could improve direct play without . the song become tedious , n't much dancing one would expect . many song forgettable , real memorable lyric , significance could easily substitute voiceover . only one song stand rest , " Papa Can you Hear Me " . it obvious other deliberately place Streisand could simply reason show vocal ability every five ten minute . chance anyone see film already know superb singer actress , song really n't replaced-dns , Streisand 's makeup , see scene man lipstick , enhanced lash , trace blush obvious make hard audience believe YentlAnschel character , actually serious , fool new friend , colleague , even Hadass , believe man . yet ask expect believe thing . there seem contradiction , character talk , rather sing , n't think pull , surprise everyone seem fool wear man 's clothing . this mean expect believe character naive ca n't see difference , action , clear giveaway . the facial difference alone can include , character film mention male relative friend n't beard facial hair . nevertheless , , woman dress man , wear much makeup Streisand 's character , still try pass man solely wear man 's clothing , would deem unacceptable cause outrage . chance would probably force leave town , even country . therefore " feminine " makeup Streisand lend character 's credibility , weaken plot . if apply make Streisand look beautiful , replaced-dns , YentlAnschel reveal truly toward end , ask believe character smart Streisand 's learn " truth " become little wise . by become apparent whole plot far fetch nothing custommade vehicle Streisand replaced-dns , fan Streisand find fault film , plot , song . to I must respectfully disagree . while excellent vocal acting ability , I " fan " style singing . however , I enjoy many feature include musical . there even song I like , I " hater " set bash . I write review honest perspective , someone try good watch movie several time even note problem within . if Streisand interested create great even believable film , could do inject need show prove talented , beautiful smart nearly every turn . this movie nothing hurt ability , make appear selfabsorbed , thus turn film laughfest unworthy fan audience .
I could n't wait see movie . about half way movie , I could n't wait end . all white actor deliver line like Woody Allen say , " say like ...

I must admit I never major Woody Allen fan , movie definitely convert . I think writing bad direction . this movie go one bad movie I ever see .
actually stop . do n't get wrong , love bad monster movie . but one way boring , regardless suspenseful music never lead anywhere . the actress many tooth moment make contact one beast , way obvious clich . this film totally betray cover DVD look pretty interesting . from cover one expect giant monster , get cute gigantic expect electric eel . move watch another film call the Killer Rats be another review . Deep Shock really crap , big shame consider fact look pretty high budget .

Parker Posey one good actress onscreen today . but film fullout travesty . watch Hartley actor talk film extra full pride , make pointless analogy Star Wars stomachturning . this hype producer part HDNET realize max . a true example Emperor new clothes . mostly I feel Hal spoil Henry FOOL forever . I n't think I ever see be pure , innocent replaced-dns Hal , fool people time ... etc. the director would nowhere today churn meaningless garbage . sadly , be pure example lesson teach film adaptation . the story must exciting active , boxoffice hope dim indeed . never mind decent story . for actor , like try act replaced-dns score , I believe Hartley 's , tasteless . with drum hit walk dialog . there one Apple Soundtrack loop I recognize give replaced-dns I see trailer , I think , oh , be try grab new audience . but be really ridiculous ride . I will happy spoil movie , have do . it be rotten . the FOOL franchise dead . long live Henry Fool .

the movie long , torture agonize end movie I have see long time . unfortunately start right opening credit . January Jones give wooden performance , I surprise n't go flame get near candle film .

I admit moment I laugh bad movie ... but laugh since whole thing way parody , feel like insult viewer 's intelligence . the bad act I ever see people ...
if want see mystery , n't watch . though element straight Elmore Leonard territory , come closer episode " Dynasty " , since filmmaker focus " character development " i.e. long , boring talk stupid , uninvolving character . some people make fascinating movie without real action see " Exotica " , one . avoid , especially like actor involve one .

Turner , Mathew Walker , Will Sanderson . direct Uwe replaced-dns video game director Uwe Boll attempt recreate game actionpacked nail biter sadly n't succeed . instead make one bad movie ever made even though get minor celebrity Christian Slater , Tara Reid Stephen Dorff movie lack necessary fundamental movie need good story line , basic relativity be go dark light . the movie bounce around Uwe Boll creative control . and mention bad CGI use make monster . even though look cool feeding well , little lame . honestly one bad movie ever make . my final rating .
no scenario , bad actor poor Melissa Gilbert ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... give budget make ... in Belgium , make ten film win price Cannes replaced-dns time I have see NULLFilm Hypercube . but scenario replaced-dns anyone know director graduate schoolfilm cop the good thing film word " end " .Why authorize sell expensive.I have pay ten dollar buy replaced-dns , pay Big MISTAKE replaced-dns replaced-dns time I will break arm buy type sht .
Baldwin really stoop low make movie . the script , music , everything movie waste replaced-dns sound FX sound real , stick way much technical gadget etc. if try make movie thing like , least try get real drop extra bleep beep , gadget n't really make loud sound like . natural sound like footstep nonexistent , give voidlike replaced-dns seem OK low budget film I sure hope low budget production , although seem fairly amateurish replaced-dns character seem empty false , simply n't casted movie well . I will imagine would have good idea make Baldwin speak Spanish make Spanish actor speak English , know language vibrant alive , actor performance suffer greatly odd language use . I mean , could finally someone realise stupid sound make international actor speak English bad accent it be have long ago bury corpse movie production . the production team ever hear subtitle this movie manage depict European police lazy corrupt , society vulnerable helpless . I mean plot go like " the Interpol ca n't jack , let be call one American bring international syndicate " replaced-dns Pictures tread path Columbia , produce movie hell . I will imagine self respect also . be buyer suppose buy every dirty title Sony put something good time year maybe have use team make Di Que Si say I do . it be speak Spanish Paz Vega Santi Millan decent job keep movie afloat . look sound much well come Sony , wake , produce less , sell .
this movie poorly script direct simply distasteful . a beautiful novel terribly misrepresent film . many change make storyline , presumably streamline timeframe . but result simply confusing . the acting ca n't possibly overcome script remove character ' motive behavior . plus , conversion English work everyone refer patriarch Esteban Esteban . horrible . please please please read gorgeous novel , Spanish possible . do N'T See This Film . it ruin could wonderful experience .
if ask first one really good one . look Sarah M .

Loosy actor , nothing story . this cruel , play . first one good actor , good story , mean . I think music good cruel intention music good cruel intention . it bad movie I see , compaer first one one big , big , big nothing .
who ever write two three glowing review either involve making film , term use loosely , bank roll , latter case , I would want seven dollar back the actor , term use loosely , awful , fact almost none anything ever relief . the scenery everything scream , dollar work day . be film someones back yard everything project say , low budget . the actor good D list . do waste time , unless course want take back try get rental back . the lead bad guy look like punk show end marry grandmother dummee Moore . my local blockbuster video store list movie return sad commentary attach . even cent rental flick gather dust . someone really must owe favors . this super stinker I give turd .
OK , be original mean , rich old geezer leave estate adult child , ungrateful loser , two creepy servant , provide spend week spooky old house . what happen night surprise n't see movie television show . after string murder victim look like be bleed restaurant ketchup , painfully obvious twist ending . the cast lead respectable actor must desperate paycheck . there also secondtier actor rise time long forget . as result , film generate drama mystery episode " Matlock . " I give credit be due closing scene clever amusing , be still awake .
this complete mess movie direct Bill Rebane , man partly responsible truly infamous anticlassic Monster aGo Go . as I near end the Cold I come unbelievable conclusion film fact even bad ' shocker . the story three eccentric millionaire invite group people remote mansion play series macabre game . whoever manage last pace survive end win , , . it be simple plot Rebane still somehow manage make proceeding verge incomprehensible . thing happen . character completely forget . nothing make much sense . and end . weirdly . I mean hell end exactly I guess leave draw conclusion . production value acting without question pornographic movie standard . in truth Pamela Rohleder Shelly n't even good . she unbelievably terrible be compelling . sadly thing can say crapfest whole , be bargain basement rotter .
I lot expectation movie since Yashraj replaced-dns operate call centre one day invite Pooja Singh teach boss , Lakhan Singh , English . the two fall love decide run away Pooja tell Jimmy ca n't owe debt Lakhan Singh , also know Bhaiyyaji . but decide steal money Jimmy find Bhaiyyaji Lakhan Singh Don . in meantime , Bhaiyyaji hire man , Bachchan Pandey , track Jimmy replaced-dns Saif Ali Khan , Kareena Kapoor , Anil Kapoor Akshaye Kumar , movie direct first time director Viay Krishna Acharya produce Aditya Chopra Yash Chopra . " Tashan " one bad film I ever watch . yes the scenery good Kareena Kapoor much publicise weight loss look good . but plot extremely thin story time make sense one scene hence I say beginning I expect film Yashraj production . with reference song , unfortunately , one song I remember replaced-dns moment one laugh mainly thanks Akshaye Kumar Saif could definitely do good Kareena Kapoor play part well . but can say Anil Kapoor suit villain . lastly , never mind Aditya Chopra , past produce direct good film " Mohabbatein , " Yash Chopra produce trash movieConclusion bad movie , worth waste time first last impression .
I think movie absolutely moral . I mean , would feel fianc leave wedding day cousin I would heartbroken it be classify comedy I n't find funny . I think mostly find cheap laugh take . I normally love Julie Stiles movie , exception . Jason Lee star another disgraceful show , prove class decent moral relevant today society . it complete lack taste I despise movie like . I understand people defend movie 's moral ' just movie ' , I still stand mark bad behaviour n't allow screen . I be try say enjoy movie , bad person , everyone entitle opinion , part movie enjoyable , I be say real life , people act like character film shameful .

I think ROTJ clearly good three Star Wars movie . I find surprising ROTJ consider weak installment trilogy many vote . to seem like ROTJ good profound plot , suspense , surprise , emotional , especially end definitely episodic movie . I personally like Empire Strike back lot also I think slightly less good ROTJ since slowermoving , episodic , I feel much suspense emotion I third replaced-dns also seem like read surprising review reason people cite ROTJ inferior film two plain ludicrous insignificant reason compare sheer excellence film whole . I hear many strange reason because Yoda die b because Bobba Fett die c because small Ewoks defeat band stormtroopers because Darth Vader revealedI would like debunk reason I believe miss point completely . first , who CARES Bobba Fett die if George Lucas want die want die . do n't get wrong I fan Bobba Fett make cameo appearance Lucas ' intention make central character film Star Wars fan make . his name even mention anywhere movie ... you go credit find Bobba Fett 's name judge ROTJ minor character die bit much I think ... secondly , many fan like Yoda die . sure , momentous period movie . I happy see die either make movie realistic . all good guy ca n't stay alive realistic movie , know . otherwise ALL good guy live ALL bad guy die movie would tantamount cheesy Saturday morning cartoon . another aspect point people like Yoda 's death . . well , nobody complain Darth Vader strike Obi Wan Kenobi a New Hope . many consider a New Hope good trilogy why Obi Wan 's death okay Yoda 's ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm ... . another reason I believe even state people find cute Ewoks overpower stormtroopers impossible . that utterly ridiculous I believe one first , Ewoks native planet Endor cognizant home terrain since live . if watch movie carefully many tactic Ewoks use defeat stormtroopers excellent use home field advantage . since live forest life I hope would learn use advantage they swing vine , rope , log set trip walker , traps . the stormtroopers highly disadvantaged outnumber aware advantage forest . the thing blasters . to add , like Ewoks battle stormtroopers , heavily assist band rebel conquest . I think stormtroopers defeat combination Star Wars hero , band rebel , well huge clan Ewoks great familiarity home terrain , would great upset . lastly , scene still unbelievable . . how Empire Strike back a New Hope SEVERAL scene group consist Han Solo , Chewbacca , Princess , shoot like ten stormtroopers blasters miss hero full view and , hero , course , always hit Stormtroopers blasters . the trooper must VERY , VERY bad aim at least Empire Strike back , Battle Endor much believable since two army pit hero legion stormtroopers . do n't believe check battle Cloud City hero escape Lando 's base . or hero rescue Princess Leia shoot somehow missedas Han Solo Luke try exit death replaced-dns last reason I care discuss other plain ridiculous spend time . people like Darth Vader reveal well , many way major part plot movie . Luke try find whether Darth Vader father , Annakin Skywalker . it would disappointing movie end without Luke get see father 's face make complete . by Annakin 's revelation symbolize transition Darth Vader undergo possess dark side helmet good person Annakin Skywalker remove helmet . the point Annakin die convert light side meaning helmet removal scene . in fact , have I would do scene I Luke 's father ... be n't would do want see son eye die mechanized helmetOn another note , I think subconscious conscious expectation among people sequel must bad even well preceding movie another reason ROTJ get many accolade deserve . I never go film deception mind , I always try go film attitude " well , might good bad original . . but I know sure . . let be see . " that way I go open mind dupe think clearly superior film good really was.I. sure criticize movie , I ask many college student adult favorite Star Wars movie tell except one person say a New Hope favorite ROTJ . I believe result poll appalling quite replaced-dns line , return Jedi good trilogy . this movie one three keep rivet throughout minute . there moment boredom scene either suspenseful , exciting , surprising , . for example , emotional light saber battle Luke father ROTJ good one Empire Strike back dayFinally , I hope people go see Phantom Menace open mind fan start look nitpicky , insignificant detail see " another sequel " trash movie " this movie stink Luke " meritorious film become another spectacular movie subject derision like ROTJ suffer unfortunately .

I Love movie . Director Michael Powell state favorite movie , mine well . Powell Pressburger create seemingly simple , superbly craft story power love " power " . however , deception lie complexity " real imaginary " premise . basically , one could argue simply depiction effect war young , poetically incline airman WWII . or the question never answer one way . actually , never even ask . this continuous understatement part film 's replaced-dns innovative photography cinematography even include nice touch portray interest filmmaker . for instance , Pressburger always want cinematic version Richard Strauss ' opera , Der Rosenkavalier , young th century Viennese aristocrat . this evident brief interlude Conductor , dress finery , hold rose appear silver heaven . the music even dreamy replaced-dns acting first rate David Niven charming , excellent support veteran Roger Livesey relative newcomer Kim Hunter . but , opinion , film 's charm come Marius Goring Conductor . he far interesting role , fill scene innocent lightheartedness , brighten film . it be pity Conductor ' scene leave cut room floor . it also pity Goring 's comedic talent rarely see film , except wonderful video the Scarlet Pimpernel television series s. this far away memorable role film career . he perfect foil relax style Niven , virtual overstatement contrast nicely seriousness rest character . ironically , also mid , Niven also star another heavenly " messenger " , play Cary Grant , the Bishop 's wife . their acting style similar I find result boring , unenergetic , disappointing . as note , accord Powell , Goring desperately want role Peter Carter , initially refuse Conductor . it be good thing give give us delightful replaced-dns movie , " commission " smooth strained relation Britain U.S. , overdrive point towards end . but disarm gentle reminder horror war numerous casualty , military civilian , need " go " face death . there conspicuous lack WWII " enemy " heaven , civilian show indeterminate origin .

Earth stop war , famine etcThe female character two , subcommander T'Pol vulcan communications officer Hoshi human . Hoshi quite wimpy T'Pol make " vulcan babe " .Some crew attitude feel bit American oppose international feel TNGcrew create interesting dynamics.A. good pilot though good series .
generally I like something light fun , film n't appeal . but grab start . the story family 's choice challenge seem obvious , raise question " what family My choice " I cry laugh I really feel people involve feel . it place difficult watch , difficult turn away . the story true , life sometimes difficult watch it show filmmaker without sex , violence , special effect good story good story . the good unpredictable story true one . like real life , really n't know will happen next , people thing
okay , I know does'nt project India good light . but overall theme movie India , be Shakti . the power warlord , power mother . the relationship Nandini husband son swallow warmth . then thing go terribly wrong . the interaction Nandini father law power dysfunctional relationship life change strength movie . Shah Rukh Khan 's performance seem mere cameo compare believable desperation Karisma Kapoor . it easy get catch love , violence redemption life film , find heave sigh relief sadness climax . the musical interlude strength , believable well do .

I entertain throughout insightful documentary , I wait good come pipe local video chain , worth wait . I like good documentary special interest piece , definitely heartfelt , honest , nostalgic , , look back adolescent life . the imagination child fascinating , be great story begin . rent buy like good , humorous , around entertaining documentary . Mr. Stein company definitely come long way neighborhood Video CamCorder production bank holdup , gayrings turn people gay one glance . they seem rather successful be respectful field , good know still good friend . the DVD extra trailer good documentary , feature number Darren 's notable production , include , Crazy News .
this version Bleak House good adaptation classic novel know . the representation court Chancery ' character ' drama magnificent . the acting marvellous , sinister Tulkinghorn , Dedlocks , Smallweed , Crooke , Miss Flyte , two young lover . but spider 's web chancery hold whole thing together , cinematography superb . what mistake BBC make copyright mean version could see UK either video DVD many year I try find , face stone wall . in end I get DVD copy Canada .
I must admit I doubt movie I go watch . the main reason compare Hitchcock movie . I have see several movie say inspire Hitchcock could make ' Master Suspense ' , far I n't see movie would able stand test time . in opinion Hitchcock become household name easily use promote cheap thriller , hand I must admit I intrigue European movie . normally be big Hollywood studio like abuse Hitchcock 's name raise income . but movie make one chauvinistic European country ever I be sure French would rather drop dead admit movie inspire Englishman . that be I decide give movie try I must say I be glad I . " Sur mes lvres " " read lip " call English , tell story young secretary name Carla . she hardwork loyal employee , never appreciate colleague . that much fact suffer hearing deficiency , deny climb hierarchical ladder company . but allow hire trainee work , change . Paul Angeli year old completely unskilled exconvict . the man thief , Carla give chance cover need . she hope teach regular life look like , time drag old life ... since I still believe name Hitchcock use often describe good thriller movie definitely I make comparison Hitchcock Jacques Audiard 's directing . fact man do really good job movie . I n't hear , true know build suspense keep interested beginning end . that also lot fine original story course . I doubt someone Hollywood ever come idea use handicapped woman powerful role , instead make helpless subject abusive husband know , typical TVmovie replaced-dns worth notice acting movie . Vincent Cassel quite famous , Emmanuelle Devos complete mystery . there absolutely nothing glamorous role , excellent job character , make feel believable realistic . Paul could average tough guy right jail Carla typically helpless woman , thanks performance , really believe two strong people bad luck life make good replaced-dns powerful movie fine script excellent acting . despite fact I doubt , I have soon become one great admirer . I give movie . do n't hesitate give try .
with death George Nader , February , I think interesting program , even though short run , tremendous idea good story line throughout . generally unseen year would worth viewing . the opening credit show many differ image , one snippit Colonel John Paul Stapp , ride famed rocket sled , point often refer " the Fastest Man Alive " .

despite quite far remove expectation , I thoroughly impress Dog Bite Dog . I rent know much , I essentially expect martial artsaction film standard Hong Kong action tradition , I devoted fan . I end get something entirely different , bad thing . while film could classify , definitely good action hand hand combat scene film , definitely primary focus . its character infinitely important film fight , rather uncommon thing many Hong Kong action movies.I. really quite surprise intricacy character character relationship film . the lead character , play Edison Chen really good , become infinitely complex end film I ever think would watch first thirty minute . the police character also defy expectation thoroughly . in fact , stark honest portrayal seldom see dark side police force quite possible favorite aspect film . I n't know I would say Dog Bite Dog entirely subvert typical notion bad criminal , good cop , certainly distort way often see film unfortunately . so many film , especially Hong Kong action film I find , portray police frankly VERY ignorantly idealize light . this one least favorite thing genre . I pleasantly surprise see Dog Bite Dog actually unique , really quite courageous , idea present police force . there negotiation scene film I never see like , doubt I ever see , sure I remember quite . also , criminal character show interesting perspective well , documentary footage film Cambodian boy old ten make fight death bare hand , I think one film 's powerful move moment . it say lot reason guy way , rather simply condemn . also , relationship Chen 's character girl meet junk yard reveal lot character . it n't element enter film I really start see film emotional experience rather visceral one . there something screen relationship n't quite get , reason one really . the actress incredible job role I imagine easy replaced-dns Bite Dog also feature really breathtaking cinematography , though unfortunately rather uneven . there moment I find really striking , particularly last segment film , also good deal camera work OK . another slight problem I pace , I also feel uneven . I find lot " look boat " scene little alienating , though quickly pick . the action scene short plentiful , truly powerful effect , particularly towards end . the fight choreography honestly impressive part , though credit solid fairly realistic , true strength emotional content behind fight . the final scene , marvel martial artistry fight choreography , one powerful final fight I ever see , I have see quite martial art films.I. suppose big determine factor whether one get much Dog Bite Dog whether connect character . all certainly flawed character one likely see film kind , something human I could n't help draw really feel , particularly Chen 's girlfriend . I say I doubt people like film much I simply I imagine people like care character way , I still recommend highly . it truly deeply move effect film give chance .

probably first Portuguese film I see life , I enjoy . the plot relate young army officer take power Portugal , finally defeat fascist government Caetano also finalize war colony , i.e. Mozambique , Angola , Guinea Bissau Cape Vert . most event show film reflect exactitude behavior army officer soldier conduct coup , oppress people , happy new development liberty , resistance Caetano 's man , also subtle way conservative official , include Spinola , take new president . the Portuguese revolution remember action several young officer , interesting part film young captain express Portugal develop democratically , country achieve year coup revolution . the film also show army officer soldier never want kill anyone ; even serious enemy respect end .

the largerthanlife figure Wyatt Earp Bat Masterson , specter George Armstrong Custer sit Bull , loom director Anthony Mann be hugely entertain first western James Stewart . although Stewart 's quest avenge father 's murder primary story , Winchester ' really ensemble piece , eponymous , oneinathousand firearm pass hand many colorful owner , include wry trader John McIntire , especially great outlaw Dan Duryea , be even despicable usual . the film 's conflation fiction history produce breezy pace ambivalent tone brilliantly step Mann 's pareddown , compositionally rigorous filmmak . his theme psychological unrest past dictate present faintly underlie tall tale good bad man chase fabled gun , starkly emerge vignette husband 's cowardice fail attempt atonement , define Stewart 's conversation sidekick Millard Mitchell . Mann 's use environment set apart filmmaker western . instead gaze vista afar , incorporate drama character redirect , complicate , evoke human character ' goal . just mountain , cave , rapids account the Naked Spur , gunfight occur amidst loose rock boulder small mountain , physical obstruction fatalistically determine role victor victim two equally skilled sharpshooter . I would remiss recognize cinematographer William H . Daniels 's contribution , particularly superlative dayfornight , openrange photography . not merely adept outdoorsman , Mann present equally vivid picture Wyatt Earppatrolled Dodge City , primarily scale , multipleplane staging . the shooting contest depend brisk camera shift twitchy cut effect Mann instinctively know place camera move display great density information give shot . nor care spell plot dialogue , rely actor ' eye wellchosen image convey stake . one scene particular serve explain attitude Mitchell be tell Stewart 's motivation Shelley Winters , interrupt climactic gunfight soon enough reveal . light without feel insubstantial , intense without overbearing , Winchester ' seem modern contemporary joy behold .
this movie essentially shoot hand hold camera actor . in way mockumentary way video diary killer full account " Columbine " style attack . while movie answer big question , give insight easy would get away . through movie show actor illegally shorten shot gun , make pipe bomb come action plan " Zero Day " . the actor call brilliant , obviously borrow heavily life , stage I detect really acting something Tom Cruise try . the use CCTV operator end genius , I be sure need last scene . overall though really good movie tough topic .
this movie one I strongly recommend . it be boy , Stanley Yelnats Shia Lebeouf wrongly convict crime send Camp Green Lake , boy ' detention center . there , force dig hole foot deep foot diamiter . while , meet boy camp Zero , Magnet , Armpit , Squid , xRay , ZigZag . all dig , ' build charactor ' , find outlaw Kate Barlow 's treasure . throughout movie book Stanley learn past , , dig hole .

at time , overtake the thing favourite horror film . while Carpenter 's film efficient entertaining flick , Kubrick 's artistic , thoughtprovoking , probably scary . it be one film I look past flaw truly wholly love .

I disagree . we know be go go crazy since us read book Jack 's appearance further notion . but be way act beginning make us truly scare . he be calm , quiet , patient . he engage inane small talk hotel manager even family . and wife son irritate , be small wonder manage . but get overlook , change . he become irritable , angry , edge . the scene always shock Wendy interrupt type , utterly lose , tell " leave f alone " . this first fbomb drop film , be shock system . from , bet replaced-dns thing I love multiple interpretation present film . we be never really sure be see actually happen . many critic note whenever Jack talk ghost , be mirror present , show may well talk . but character Wendy never see anything film 's climax , give tour hotel 's many ghostly inhabitant , well aware something wrong , Danny connect place almost immediately . his psychic power question else would Hallorann know come hotel ever see ghost parent witness it be easy claim Jack merely lose , trap hotel family , Wendy later well see husband attempt kill axe Danny it appear body take Tony , know sure none character reliable witness . Hallorann probably would , warn danger , be kill soon arrive Overlook scare Kubrick achieve play assumption fan novel . and final shot . have ever enigmatic ending cinema Has Jack really or body merely ' absorb ' hotel when talk acting film , discussion begin end Jack Nicholson . Shelley Duvall give one annoy performance cinematic history probably purpose , give Jack 's character reason snap Danny Lloyd good , Jack powerhouse . part method , part improvisation , be simultaneously terrifying appealing . for well bad , be character identify , annoy kid nagging wife . we want hotel season , able whatever want . who care be haunt of course , technical aspect terrific . Kubrick 's long take , strange angle , bizarre imagery contribute horror . the use colour , mirror , long hallway , every motif heighten . and n't even get start score . I n't know film would half scary without haunting , electronic tune . its strangeness perfectly reflect hotel , mood , entire film itself.I. know King n't like film , King 's input cinema nothing brag . as great novel writer may , screenplay terrible , attempt directing well leave unnoticed . this faithful book adaptation , n't need , really n't . part horror film viewer n't book fall back ; be reassuring source material . Kubrick masterfully alter narrative terrify audience even . if , one innovative film genre . and have get everything else top .

I find human ambiguity far facinating human perfection . that " the last Temptation Christ " good film " King Kings " , also one reason I think " Rob Roy " good " Braveheart " . Rob Roy may heroic brave , far perfect . he make several mistake affect life many love one . now sure , bear false claim Duke Argyll act nobility courage , also act egoism self centeredness . let us forget kinfolk claim protect drive homeless end film act . but Rob good could , could ask replaced-dns ' wife Mary , also normal , ambigious person . let us start though , look film . sure , be beautiful , n't wear makeup basically allow natural beauty show . compare two love one , depend point view William Wallace " Braveheart " . now two lady hot , hardly indicitive woman look time especially lay person . maybe fair comparison , another example Rob Roy 's attempt accuracy far replaced-dns " Rob Roy " , Mary live vicious rape dastardly carrion , Cunningham . she feel compel tell Rob struggle , n't know Rob must seek revenge rape . such revenge would surely mean death Rob , Mary prepare replaced-dns villain " Rob Roy " equally compelling . although enemy " Braveheart " well write , hardly original .

" Rob Roy " simply teach us circumstance decrease value change . it problem throughout human history vanity human heart allow capacity compassion . Rob Roy Mary give us hope goodness prevail , snake always exist replaced-dns character I find fascinating Duke Argyll . he true nobleman , value honesty courtesy direct contrast Marquis . he appreciate bravery Rob Roy Mary , direct vexation Marquis factor . he give world hope people power . hopefully , people like Marquis exception rule . the final duel " Rob Roy " exciting battle scene " Braveheart " .One thing I get tired people tell " Braveheart " good film battle scene . first , battle scene hardly original . from " Spartacus " " Gladiator " , Hollywood long tradition historical European battle scene . " Braveheart " good battle scene ever put film , suffer one important problem . these battle scene context except fight replaced-dns , n't get wrong , duel hardly original either . in fact , probably time many film duel battle scene . but context duel Cunningham Rob Roy beauty behold . it one great scene film history . let explain ... first , fight style bearing two character duel describe character perfectly .

" Rob Roy " realistic " Braveheart " I n't know people aristocracy Scotsman talk like people " Rob Roy " , I feel clearly attempt capture speech pattern .

" Rob Roy " actually one great written film ' . many dialogue film clever , maybe watch film couple time understand replaced-dns contrast , dialogue " Braveheart " hardly interesting . of course , expect main character Scotsman play Australian This legend , clearly attempt capture speech time . this film take place several century " Rob Roy " , yet talk like people today . thus reason many people like good . audience today become increasingly lazy , n't want take time patience understand thing complex . therefore , many epic film , expect see villians speak recognizable English accent hero speak vernacular far away American language . sure , clear Wallace Scotish , sound like Scotty Star Trek couple " Aye " acknowledgement , Scot film fit Hollywood tradition believe Scot replaced-dns , description prove " Rob Roy " good film " Braveheart " hardly . but prove one thing , show hardly common knowledge " Braveheart " good film " Rob Roy " . to put simply , " Rob Roy " film theme apropos today 's world .
